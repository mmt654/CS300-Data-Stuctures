# CS300-Data-Stuctures

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were solving a problem where a school system wanted a program that would sort through courses and required courses for a student to be able to schedule the next set of classes if the requirments are met.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I tried to approach the problem from what the output needed to look like and data structures are important to understand because they are needed to be able to sort and store information.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I went back to past projects and tried to learn how things are done and understand how they work. Going back a going over the past assignment helped alot with gaining insight into this project.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I would say it has woken me up and made me slow my role and try to understand how everything work more than just powering through it and also looking at what the output needs to look like.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I try to put more comments that are descrpitive to what i'm trying to accomplish and if someone has to come back through can understand everyhting also trying to keep everything clean and organized to make the navigation of the code easier when maintaining and adapting.
